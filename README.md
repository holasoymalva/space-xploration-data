## Overview

This repository contains regularly updated space-related data collected from various APIs. The data is automatically refreshed through a Python script that fetches information, updates the JSON files, and commits changes to this repository.

## Data Structure

The repository organizes space data in the following structure:

```
data/
├── space_data.json       # Main dataset with space launches information
└── [future datasets]     # Additional datasets may be added over time
```

### Data Format

The primary dataset (`space_data.json`) follows this structure:

```json
{
  "launches": [
    {
      "id": "unique-launch-id",
      "name": "Mission Name",
      "date_utc": "2023-03-15T10:30:00Z",
      "details": "Mission details and description",
      "success": true,
      "links": {
        "patch": {
          "small": "url-to-patch-image",
          "large": "url-to-patch-image"
        },
        "webcast": "url-to-webcast",
        "article": "url-to-article"
      },
      "updated_at": "2023-03-15T12:45:30Z"
    },
    // Additional launches...
  ]
}
```

## Data Sources

The data is sourced from the following APIs:
- [SpaceX API](https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/)
- [Additional APIs may be incorporated in the future]

## Update Frequency

This repository's data is automatically updated hourly. Each update includes:
- New space launches
- Updated mission information
- Additional space-related data
